# MOOC Java Programming Exercise Solutions

Welcome to the MOOC Java Programming Exercise Solutions repository! This repository contains exercise solutions for the Java Programming course offered by MOOC, provided by the University of Helsinki.

## Course Overview

The Java Programming course is designed to teach the fundamentals of Java programming, algorithms, and object-oriented programming concepts. It is divided into two parts:

- Java Programming I: Covers Part 1 to Part 7 of the course, focusing on the basics of Java programming, including variables, loops, arrays, and object-oriented programming principles.
- Java Programming II: Covers Part 8 to Part 14 of the course, delving deeper into advanced topics such as file handling, error handling, data structures, and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- Java Programming I: This folder contains exercise solutions for Part 1 to Part 7 of the Java Programming course.
- Java Programming II: This folder contains exercise solutions for Part 8 to Part 14 of the Java Programming course.

Each part within the folders corresponds to a specific section of the course and includes its own exercise set.

## Context

This repository was prepared during my study of the Java course in the 7th semester of my college. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology (BSC.CSIT).

In each Java file, I have removed the `public` keyword before the class name for file naming conventions. For example, instead of naming the file as `Sandbox.java`, I am saving it as `01-Sandbox.java`. This convention helps in organizing the files effectively.

## How to Use this Repository?

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the relevant part folder (Java Programming I or Java Programming II).
3. Explore the exercises within the part folder. Each exercise solution is implemented and tested according to the requirements provided in the course materials.
4. Review the code, study the solutions, and gain insights into various Java programming concepts.
5. Feel free to modify or enhance the solutions based on your understanding and creativity.
6. If you have improvements or alternative solutions, consider contributing back to the repository by submitting a pull request.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have improvements, alternative solutions, or additional exercises to share, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can create a valuable resource for Java programming learners.
